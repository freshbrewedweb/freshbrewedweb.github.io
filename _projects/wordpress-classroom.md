## Installation

1. Upload the `classroom` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## 3rd Party Services

You have the option to use [Wistia](https://wistia.com) as a video provider. In order to do this, we need to communicate with their servers.

## Usage

Most of the time, you'll want to sell private access to your classes. This can be accomplished by installing [Groups](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/groups/) and [WooCommerce](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

Once installed, you can restrict access on a class or course basis by assigning them to a Group. Then, simply create a product and designate which Group they should be added to after purchase.
