This plugin provides a shortcode to selectively disable WordPress' automatic formatting. Very useful for anyone looking to write some custom HTML, but doesn't want to completely diasble wpautop.

[Download from WordPress ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-format-shortcode/){: .button}

Wrap any HTML content, or content for which you wish to disable formatting inside of the [noformat] shortcode, like this:

```
[noformat]
<ul>
  <li>This content won't be
    formatted.
</ul>

You'll notice no automatic <p>'s or <br/>'s are added within this shortcode.
[/noformat]
```
