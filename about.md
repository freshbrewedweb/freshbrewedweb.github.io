## History

**Fresh Brewed Web** was officially founded in 2015 and is the culmination of over 10 years of web development by its founder, Greg Hunt.

## Artisanal Code

Our roots were in design and marketing but we quickly became a dev shop specializing in front-end integration.

Nowadays, we offer a full stack of services to bring life to quality web applications. At the same time, we make a point not to spread ourselves thin by offering marketing and other extraneous services. We can offer consultation for marketing, and our websites are certainly search engine friendly...

> ...but our focus remains on providing craftsmanship to the code that runs your web.
>
> Code that's brewed with an artisan's touch.

## Team

We're a small team, and that's our strength.
