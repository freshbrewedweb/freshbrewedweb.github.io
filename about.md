## History

**Fresh Brewed Web** was officially founded in 2015 and has been the culmination of over 10 years of web development by its founder, Greg Hunt.

## Artisanal Code

Our roots were in design and marketing but we quickly became a dev shop specializing in front end integration.

Nowadays, we offer a full stack of services to bring life to quality web applications - while at the same time, not spreading ourselves thin by offering marketing and other extraneous services. We can offer consultation in marketing, and you better believe our websites are search engine friendly, but our focus remains on providing a craftmanship-like quality to the code that runs the web.

## Team

We're a small team, and that's our strength.
